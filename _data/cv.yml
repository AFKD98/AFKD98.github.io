- title: Key Projects
  type: list
  contents:
    - "Systems for ML: Optimized state-of-the-art distributed learning systems, focusing on enhancing resource utilization, scalability, and efficiency through the development of specialized computing and storage solutions for resource-constrained environments. This research led to papers that were published and presented at conferences including BigData’22, BigData’23, and EuroSys’24, and submissions in EuroSys’25."
    - "Privacy-aware Learning: Designed and developed Horizontal and Vertical Federated Learning (HFL & VFL) frameworks, enhancing privacy in distributed environments. In addition, implemented MLOps pipelines that leverage cloud resources and integrate with major ML libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and FLOWER. This work contributed to publications at IEEE Access’23, and the FL-AAAI’22."
    - "Personalized ML: Developed enhanced personalization solutions for resource-constrained distributed ML systems, aiming to tailor models more effectively to individual user needs. This work led to contributions under review at NeurIPS’24, AAAI."
    - "Incentivized ML: Improved incentive mechanisms within distributed and collaborative resource-constrained ML systems to ensure fairness and adaptability across diverse user groups and scenarios. This work led to contributions towards IEEE CLOUD’22, AAAI-AIES’24, and AAAI’25."
    - "LLMs fine-tuning: Developed a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) approach that utilizes human preferences for rapid optimization of text-to-image tasks. Furthermore, introduced a DPO method to reduce sycophancy by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using a curated dataset. These contributions are under review at COLM’24 and ICML Workshop’24."
    - "DevOps: Designed a distributed and containerized system with a dynamic pipeline to support the data analytical modules for Cyber Infrastructure for Waterborne Antibiotic Resistance Risk Surveillance (CI4-WARS)."
    - "Program Analysis: Developed an LLVM-based counter fuzzing approach that’s undetectable by leading fuzzers such as AFL and balances performance with countermeasures."
