I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Virginia Tech in the <a href='https://research.cs.vt.edu/dssl/people.html'>DSSL lab</a> working with <a href='https://people.cs.vt.edu/butta/'>Dr. Ali R. Butt</a>. My research is focused on Machine Learning Systems and Federated Learning.

Currently, I am working on (1) Sys4ML: Enhancing resource utilization, scalability, and efficiency of distributed learning on resource-constrained systems by developing specialized (computing and storage) systems for distributed ML. (2) ML4Sys: (i)Personalized ML: Developing enhanced personalized learning solutions for resource-constrained distributed ML systems. (ii) Incentivized ML: Improving incentive mechanisms within resource-constrained distributed ML systems to ensure fairness and adaptability. (3) LLMs fine-tuning: Fine-tuning LLMs to reduce sycophancy and prompt optimization for specific tasks. (4) LLMs for FL: Fine-tuning LLMs with privacy-aware data and utilizing LLMs as human replacements in Federated Learning. 

I did my B.S. in Computer Science from LUMS University working with <a href='https://www.ihsanqazi.com/'>Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi</a> and <a href='https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/'>Dr. Zafar Ayyub Qazi</a>.
